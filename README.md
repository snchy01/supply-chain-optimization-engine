# Supply Chain Optimization Engine
### End-to-End Data Pipeline & Prescriptive Analytics on Databricks

**Project Overview:** This project demonstrates a production-grade data pipeline designed to manage and optimize inventory for **100,000+ SKUs**. By integrating **Big Data processing** (PySpark) with **Operations Research** (Linear Programming), the engine identifies stock-out risks and mathematically allocates a limited budget to minimize operational impact.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture
The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** to ensure data quality and reliability:

* **Bronze Layer (Raw):** Synthetic generation of 100,000+ supply chain transaction logs and inventory records.
* **Silver Layer (Cleansed):** Data transformation using **PySpark Window Functions** to calculate **ABC Categories**, **Stock-out Risk Scores**, and **Lead Time Variability**.
* **Gold Layer (Optimized):** A final "Procurement Plan" table, generated by a mathematical solver, providing prescriptive order quantities.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
* **Platform:** Databricks (Community Edition / Serverless)
* **Languages:** Python (PySpark, Scipy), SQL
* **Data Processing:** Spark SQL, Spark DataFrames
* **Optimization:** `scipy.optimize.linprog` (Two-Phase Simplex Method)
* **Storage:** Delta Lake

## 🚀 Key Engineering Achievements
1.  **High-Volume Processing:** Engineered a pipeline to handle **100,000+ records** efficiently using distributed computing.
2.  **Strategic Categorization:** Implemented **ABC Analysis** (Pareto Principle) to prioritize high-value inventory items (Category A).
3.  **Advanced Optimization:** Developed a **Two-Phase Simplex Solver** to navigate complex constraints:
    * **Objective:** Minimize total stock-out risk.
    * **Constraint:** Stay within a fixed **$100,000 budget**.
    * **Constraint:** Meet minimum safety stock requirements for critical items.
